## Description of Project

- Dataset Acquisition: We begin by obtaining a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about second-hand cars, including features such as make, model, year, mileage, condition, etc. We Ensured that the dataset is suitable for training a machine learning model for price prediction.

- Data Preprocessing: We clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and encoding categorical variables. Perform feature engineering, such as extracting additional features from existing ones.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Visualize relationships between variables, identify correlations, and understand the distribution of the target variable (car prices) along with other relevant features.

- Model Training: Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets. Implement the linear regression, lasso regression, random forest regression algorithm using a scikit-learn machine learning library. Train the model on the training set, and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).

- Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and validated, prepare it for deployment. This typically involves serializing the trained model to a file format (e.g., pickle).

- Webpage Development: Create a webpage using web development technologies such as HTML, CSS. Design an interface that allows users to input the necessary features of a car (e.g., make, year, mileage) and submit a prediction request.

- Backend Development: Implemented the backend of the webpage using a suitable programming language and web framework (e.g., Python with Flask). Load the trained model and any required preprocessing steps. Develop an API endpoint that receives the user's input, preprocesses it, and passes it through the trained model to obtain a price prediction.

- Model Integration: Connect the trained model to the webpage's backend by calling the appropriate API endpoint. Ensure that the user's input is correctly processed and the prediction is returned to the webpage.

- Testing and Deployment: Thoroughly test the webpage and its integration with the model to ensure proper functionality. Once all testing is complete, deploy the webpage to a hosting platform or server to make it accessible to users.

<!-- - Report Documentation: Finally, create a report summarizing the entire project, including details about the dataset, data preprocessing steps, model training process, performance evaluation, webpage development, and model deployment. Include relevant code snippets, visualizations, and insights gained from the analysis. Clearly explain the approach, limitations, and future improvements that can be made to enhance the model's accuracy and usability. -->
